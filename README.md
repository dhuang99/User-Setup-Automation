## About The Project
During my summer internship, I was given 100+ new computers to image and setup for new incoming employees. Imaging the computer was simple enough as the image was stored on the company network, but the setup portion of the task was completely manual.
</br> </br>
There was a list of tasks that I had to perform once the computer was imaged. These inlcude, but not limited to registering the computer to the company network, changing security settings for specific folders, adding the company printers, and installing the most up to date drivers. In total, it would take around 10 minutes of messing with settings to finish setting up each computer. 
</br> </br>
I did not want to spend so much time doing boring manual work, so I made this script to do the work for me. I put the code on my Github to demonstrate my work, but I highly recommend against running this script as it does change some settings on you computer such as turning off hibernate.


## Getting Started
While the script will likely not prove much use as it was specific to the company's imaging process, you can download it and check it out. 
</br> </br>
*I highly recommend against running this code as it will make unwanted changes to some settings on your computer.*

### Prerequisites
You need to run this script on a Windows 10 machine. There should be no other prerequisites as I use no other third party packages. I have not tested whether it is backwards compatible with previous versions of Windows.

### Installation
To download the script, download the zip file and extract it. You can then move the script to your desired location. 

## Usage
You can run the scripts, but much of the functionality has been lost as the executables that the scripted referenced were specific to the company. To protect the company's privacy, I have changed the code so that it has no information that would expose the identity of the company. Thus, the code cannot run as it does not have the proper executables.

## Road Map
Since I do not forsee myself working at the company again, I do not forsee myself working on this script in the future as it is specific to the company that I interned at. However, you can check out [my profile](https://github.com/dhuang99) to see my story and other projects!
