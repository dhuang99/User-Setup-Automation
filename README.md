## About The Project



## Getting Started
While the script will likely not prove much use as it was specific to the company's imaging process, you can download it and check it out. 
</br> </br>
*Please note that it currently does not run properly as I changed the executables to gibberish to protect the company's privacy.*

### Prerequisites
You need to run this script on a Windows 10 machine. There should be no other prerequisites as I use no other third party packages. I have not tested whether it is backwards compatible with previous versions of Windows.

### Installation
To download the script, download the zip file and extract it. You can then move the script to your desired location. 

## Usage
You cannot run the scripts as the executables that the scripted used were specific to the company. To protect the company's privacy, I have changed the code so that it has no information that would expose the identity of the company. Thus, the code cannot run as it does not have the proper executables.

## Road Map
Since I do not forsee myself working at the company again, I do not forsee myself working on this script in the future as it is specific to the company that I interned at. However, you can check out [my profile](https://github.com/dhuang99) to see my story and other projects!
